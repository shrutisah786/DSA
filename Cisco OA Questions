Question 1 : Coin Game
Raman was playing a game,  he starts with x coins. Now in every step, he wins and loses and he has to get the money or pay the money as needed. He came in contact with a psychic who can see the future and the Psychic predicted the outcomes after each step. Now Raman wants to start the game with the minimum wage where he doesnâ€™t run out of money.  Help Raman to find what money he should start with. The only rule to keep playing is not going in a credit situation.

Input Format:
First line with n, number of steps in the game
Next n lines, n integers denoting outcomes of every game. Positive means winning and negative means losing that money.

Output Format:
One single integer denoting the minimum amount to start with

Constraints:
Number of steps<=10^9
-1000<=Money needed in each step<=1000

Sample Input:
4
2,-9,15,2

Sample Output:
7

Explanation:
If he starts with 7 rupees, then after steps : 7 ->9 -> 0-> 15 -> 17.

//Solution
import java.util.*;
public class CoinGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt(); // Number of steps
        int[] steps = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            steps[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int sum = 0;
        int minPrefix = 0;
        for (int step : steps) {
            sum += step;
            minPrefix = Math.min(minPrefix, sum);
        }
        // Raman needs at least this much to never go negative
        System.out.println(-minPrefix);
    }
}
